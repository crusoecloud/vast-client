# Vast Data Client

This repository contains an auto-generated Golang SDK for interacting with the Vast Data API.

## Important: Do Not Regenerate

This repository includes **manual overrides** on top of the generated output. **Do not regenerate** the SDK (e.g. via OpenAPI Generator) as a routine workflow, or you may overwrite these overrides.

## How to Use This Repository

The [Makefile](Makefile) for this repository includes a target that uses the [OpenAPI
generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to generate a Golang SDK from the [Vast Data API
spec](vast_swagger_api.yaml) provided by Vast. Regeneration is supported, but should be treated as a **manual, deliberate** operation due to the overrides described above.

Any new API additions or modifications should be done **manually** in this repository. For approval/review, reach out in Slack: [#cloud-storage-dev](https://crusoe.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C067JPR3ABW).
